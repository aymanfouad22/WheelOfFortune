Wheel of Fortune Game
Project Overview
The Wheel of Fortune Game is a console-based Java application inspired by the classic TV game show. The objective is to guess a hidden phrase, where the phrase is initially represented by asterisks, and correct guesses reveal the corresponding letters. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the phrase correctly. The game interacts with the user through the console, providing feedback on the guesses and updating the hidden phrase accordingly.
